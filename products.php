        <p class="center" style="font-size: large;"> This delightful pasta dish celebrates the freshness 
            of spring! For an extra light and velvety sauce, 
            use an immersion blender to combine blanched asparagus and ricotta cheese with a tablespoon 
            of our Extra Virgin Olive Oil—though most blenders and food processors will work! 
            (As an optional garnish, you may also set aside a few tops of the asparagus spears to add at the end!) 
            We used Einkorn Spaghetti for an addition of wholesome ancient grains in this recipe, but feel free to 
            use your preferred variety of spaghetti. Toss with a bit of lemon zest for an extra burst of brightness, then garnish with salty chopped pistachios for the perfect added crunch!
